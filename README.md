# Roman Numeral Converter

Roman Numeral Converter algorithm for the freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures.

## What Is The Problem?

> Convert the given number into a roman numeral.
>
> All [roman numerals](https://www.mathsisfun.com/roman-numerals.html) answers should be provided in upper-case.

## How It Works

- The function takes a number and will go through a while loop checking against each case and will add each roman numeral to the romanNum value outside of the loop.
- Each Loop will check from highest to lowest subtracting each value until it reaches 0.
- Once out of the loop it will return the value of romanNum.
